# Wlout - Wayland Outputs Command Line Tool

This CLI tool's job is to manage displays (heads) on Wayland compositors that use the Wayland Protocols.
It uses the still experimental `wlr_output_management_unstable_v1` so things are subjected to changes at any time.

Compatible with sway, hyprland and should work with other compositors using wlroots:
https://github.com/solarkraft/awesome-wlroots?tab=readme-ov-file#compositors

It is written in Rust and depends on the following packages:

- wayland-client
- wayland-protocols-wlr
- clap
- clap_complete

For more information visit the official wayland protocols repository.

## Philosophy & Features

- The tool's goal is to be a successor of the popular `xrandr` (tool for x11) and `wlr-randr` tools, but with a modern
  twist.
- Autocomplete is a first-class citizen
- Quality of life features (verifications when turning off last display, using the best common resolution when mirroring etc...)

Unix philosophy

- Doing only one thing per command
- Standard parsable outputs
- Standard cli shape, no flags soup
- Self-explorable
- Self-documented

## Installation

- Arch based distributions

  Using your favorite AUR helper https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wlout

  ```
  yay -Sy wlout
  ```

## Usage

- General use: `wlout <verb> <display> <option>`

## Examples

- List your displays: `wlout list`
- Turn off/on a display: `wlout power HDMI-A-1 <off|on>`
- List resolution and refresh rates for a display: `wlout mode HDMI-A-1 list`
- Set resolution and refresh rate for a display: `wlout mode HDMI-A-1 set 1920x1080@60`
- Move a display to an absolute position: `wlout move HDMI-A-1 position 0 0`

## Shell Completion

Add `source <(wlout completion <shell_name>)` in your shell's rc profile file.

Where <shell_name> is one of:

- zsh
- bash
- fish (partially implemented)
- elvish (partially implemented)

## Screen Placement Optimisation

When you move your primary display relative to another display you can end-up having coordinates that are no-longer
close to the origin (0, 0). If you keep moving your displays one over the other you can hit the limit of the virtual
desktop.
To prevent this issue the `wlout move` command performs a position optimisation of your displays after each move.

It first finds the display closest to the origin, then calculates the delta x and delta y needed to position it on (0,
0). Lastly the delta transition is applied on all displays to keep their relative positions.

## Building

Manually

```
cargo build
install target/debug/wlout ~/.local/bin
```

Or using Taskfile

`task install`

## Roadmap

- [x] Add dynamic shell completions for bash
- [ ] Add dynamic shell completions for fish
- [x] Detect unsupported environments and show warning
- [x] Add GPLv3 license
- [x] Add case-insensitive dynamic parameters support (ex edp <tab> yielding eDP-1)
- [ ] Add dbus KWin support for KDE
- [x] Prevent switching off last display
- [x] Use preferred screen mode when duplicating
- [ ] Allow to not use "best common resolution" when mirroring via a flag
- [x] Add mode <display> auto command that uses the screen preferred mode
- [x] Optimize positions default screen by keeping a virtual map of all screens
- [x] Add to AUR
- [ ] Add adaptive sync options
- [ ] Add transform options
- [x] Add "set preferred mode"
- [ ] Add some unit tests

## AI Disclaimer

The project is 95% written by hand, but an LLM assistant has been used for the dynamic shell completion functions due to
their hard (for me) syntax.
